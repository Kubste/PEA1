CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:12 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findxlsxwriter.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project
  has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
  "xlsxwriter", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "xlsxwriter" with
  any of the following names:

    xlsxwriterConfig.cmake
    xlsxwriter-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "xlsxwriter" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "xlsxwriter_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
  "xlsxwriter" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has
  been installed.
